# Traffic_Sign_Classification
In this project, I have performed classification of different traffic signs with the help of convolutional neural networks.

This classification project deals with the classification of traffic signs into different categories with the help of 
convolutional neural networks.

I have used dataset which is available on Kaggle over here "https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign"

This convolutional neural network model is built with the help of Keras library with an accuracy of 97%

I have visualized the results of this CNN model in a GUI with the help of tkinter where we can upload the image and then look the 
category in which that image falls.

Once the traffic classification GUI is initialized, it shows up with the screen shown below.

After this, the *upload image* button is pressed to upload an image stored in the local system for predicting the traffic sign.

Lastly, when the image is uploaded, *classify image* button is pressed to classify the image and recognize it with the name of 
the traffic sign displayed above the image.
