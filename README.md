# Traffic_Sign_Classification
In this project, I have performed classification of different traffic signs with the help of convolutional neural networks.

This classification project deals with the classification of traffic signs into different categories with the help of 
convolutional neural networks.

I have used dataset which is available on Kaggle over here ""

This convolutional neural network model is built with the help of Keras library with an accuracy of 97%

I have visualized the results of this CNN model in a GUI with the help of tkinter where we can upload the image and then look the 
category in which that image falls.
